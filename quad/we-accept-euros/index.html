            <p class="lead">Al’s Deli has a palpable French flare: Pictures of Parisian landmarks line its walls, and smells of freshly baked baguettes waft from its kitchen out to a long line of customers. Sandwiched between the Coffee Lab and Tomate Fresh Kitchen, Al’s deli has been a Noyes street staple for over 65 years.</p>

<p>Owners and brothers Bob and John Pottinger wear their mutual love of Paris on the sleeves of their matching white aprons.</p>

<p>“We’re both terrible Francophiles, so as soon as we started running the business we started doing all sorts of French things here,” says Bob, co-owner of Al’s. “It’s a niche that we fill and we’re also doing what’s in our heart.” </p>

<p>Bob and John’s father, Al, was a chef in the Navy during World War II. After coming home to Evanston, he worked in a nearby grocery store until the empty space on Noyes Street opened. In 1949, he decided he wanted to run a grocery store of his own and opened up Al’s Deli.</p>

<p>“It was supposed to be temporary, but you know how temporary things go in family businesses,” Bob says of his job at Al’s. “So I’ve been here for 45 years.” </p>

            </figure>

<p>In the beginning, Al’s was a gourmet grocery market, and the deli did not have a very imaginative menu.</p>

<p>When Bob joined the team after graduating from college, he decided to add his own personal touch to the menu. “When my brother John and I came on board, the main sandwich that we sold here was roast beef on white bread with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise,” Bob says. </p>

<p>A French deli seemed like the obvious solution for the Pottinger brothers, who both discovered a passion for Paris at a young age. Bob fell in love with the city after watching a short film called<i> The Red Balloon.</i></p>

<p>“It’s about a little boy in Paris who has a red balloon that follows him all around the city and he stops in a patisserie and gets a pastry,” Bob says. “It’s a wonderful little film and ever since then I’ve wanted to visit Paris.”</p>

<p>After years of hard work and saving, Bob now goes to Paris twice a year to explore the sights and tastes of his favorite city.</p>

<p>Because of Bob’s frequent visits to Paris, the Pottingers are willing to accept Euros at their store. So if you have a few extra coins lying around after studying abroad, the Pottingers will take them off your hands in exchange for a French treat. </p>

<p>“It’s a good deal for everybody,” Bob says. “I give a good exchange rate, and at the end of the day I just put them in my sock and when I head to Paris I have like a thousand Euros in my pocket, which is good walking around money. You can buy a lot of chocolate éclairs.”</p>
